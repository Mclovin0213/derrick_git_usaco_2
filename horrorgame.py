    Entity 001: The Bell Head
    Class: Fodder
    Bell Heads are an entity found within various levels, such as Level 2, Level 16, Level 16.5, etc.
    They can be killed with a gun. Bell Heads will not attack unless they see you. If you kill one, they
    may drop the bell on their head, which can be crafted into the Bellblade. Bell Heads often appear during
    the night cycle of a level, but are not super dangerous. However, when in large groups, they may
    overwhelm you with their sheer numbers.

    Sculptors are only found on 2 levels, Level 6 and Level X. They can be found in groups of 1 to 3, and

    will turn towards you with chisel in hand. Sculptors usually take around 2 shots from the standard 
    pistol to kill. If you can, avoid them, as they can drain your ammunition quickly.
